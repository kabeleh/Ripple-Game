 * Generate dates for puzzles based on a stable schedule.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The app launched on Dec 30, 2025 on LinkedIn.
 * - Archive starts from Dec 30, 2025 (first playable puzzle)
 * - A fixed date schedule is used for existing puzzles, so dates never shift
 * - New puzzles added to the end are scheduled AFTER the fixed block
 *
 * TIMEZONE: All date calculations use HST (Pacific/Honolulu, UTC-10) as the reference.
 * HST was chosen to give users worldwide maximum time before daily reset.
 * Hawaii doesn't observe DST, so reset is always at midnight HST (10am UTC).
 * This is especially helpful for Australian users who get extra hours before reset.
